## CTF Notes

### General Notes:
> The challenge is BUILT AROUND the exploit (at easy to medium level)...  

> Find the vulnerability as soon as possible (it would help to DM the admins and CONFIRM)  

> Only then find a way to get the flag...

However I will not bother trying to keep things compatible/up to date with his, so things may be slightly different here and there but that's ok. I need some things because I have serious skill issue but he does not. (l33t h4ck3rm4n)
