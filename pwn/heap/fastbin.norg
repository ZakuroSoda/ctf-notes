* Key concepts

  Fastbins are FIFO singly-linked lists. There are 10 fastbins which are separated by specific sizes of chunks from 0x10
  to 0x90. 

  The structure of a freed chunk in a fastbin looks like this:

  @code
  +------------------+
  | prev_size | size |
  |------------------|
  | fd        | ?    |
  +------------------+
  @end

  The top chunk in a fastbin will have fd = 0.

* Fastbin attack

  With a UAF you can edit the fd to point to arbitrary addresses.
