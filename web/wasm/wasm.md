# Web Assembly Guide/Exploits

We first need to download the WASM binary source. Try and find the endpoint and enter the URL to download.

Decompile using https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wasm2wat/

Next step is to understand the WASM, OR try to ctrl+f the flag (it may be encrypted so you can't directly grep the flag format)

Get your low-level pwn guy to do the rest from asm.
